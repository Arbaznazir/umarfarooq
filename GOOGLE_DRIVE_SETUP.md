## üîê Environment Variables Setup

# =============================================================================

# Service Account Email (from JSON file: client_email)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Service Account Private Key (from JSON file: private_key)
# Note: Keep the quotes and \n characters as they are
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour_Private_Key_Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# Google Drive Folder ID (Optional - folder where PDFs will be stored)
# If not set, files will be stored in the root of the service account's accessible drive
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_google_drive_folder_id_here
```

### üîí Important Security Notes:
